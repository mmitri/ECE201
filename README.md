# ECE201

ECE201 Junior year Spring semester. This is all my coding projects, homework, exams, ect. for the class ECE201 at Lehigh University

ECE201 Description: This course is an intensive introduction to the fundamentals of computer
architecture. We will discuss the basic design, or architecture, of
computing hardware. Computer systems involve architecture design at
many levels. We will focus on the instruction set architecture (ISA) level
(the interface between the software and computing hardware) and the
microarchitecture level (the computing hardware itself). We will also
examine to some extent, the level above the instruction set (the
programming language level) and the level below the microarchitecture
(the logic gate level) in order to deepen our understanding of computing
systems
